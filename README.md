# Hide Tray Icons

Hide Tray Icons is a GNOME Shell extension for hiding any legacy Tray Icons that would get special treatment otherwise, e.g. Wine tray icons.

The motivation behind this extension was to get rid of the Wine System Tray that would pop up in Gnome Shell when e.g. the Rockstar launcher comes up when starting GTA5 or RDR2.

## Installation

Copy the `hideTrayIcons@jp7677` folder to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`. The `intall.sh` script is doing exactly this.

## Notes

- This extension will surely conflict with other tray-icons extensions.
- This extension does the job for hiding the Wine Task Tray, though using this extension might not be the best way to achieve this. There is probably a more simple or more elegant way for doing so.
